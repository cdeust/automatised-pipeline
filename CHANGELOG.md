# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.3] — Schema-guarded edge resolution

### Added

- `is_known_rel_table` helper in `graph_store.rs` — public predicate
  over `REL_TABLES` so producers that build relationship-table names
  from runtime symbol labels can validate before insertion instead of
  failing inside the graph driver.
- `Imports_File_Method` declared in `REL_TABLES`; previously a method
  imported directly from a file produced a dropped edge with no
  recoverable target table.

### Fixed

- `resolver::resolve_single_import`, `resolve_glob_import`,
  `resolve_calls`, and `resolve_field_type_uses` now consult
  `is_known_rel_table` before staging an edge. Unknown labels are
  logged (first 8 occurrences via an `AtomicU64` counter to bound
  log volume) and the edge is dropped — this replaces the previous
  hard failure path when a new caller/target label combination
  appeared at runtime.
- `lsp_resolver::try_add_lsp_edge` applies the same guard to
  LSP-derived edges (rust-analyzer / pyright / tsserver).

### Added — public-readiness baseline (carried over from Unreleased)

- Public-readiness baseline: LICENSE (MIT, sole independent author),
  CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md.
- GitHub issue templates (bug / feature / audit-finding) and PR template
  with audit-cycle checklist.

## [0.0.2] — Stage 1–9 wired + 23 MCP tools

### Added

- 23 MCP tools across pipeline stages 0 through 9:
  - Stage 0: `health_check`
  - Stage 1: `extract_finding`, `refine_finding`
  - Stage 2: `start_verification`, `append_clarification`,
    `finalize_verification`, `abort_verification`
  - Stage 3a: `index_codebase`, `query_graph`, `get_symbol`
  - Stage 3b: `resolve_graph`, `lsp_resolve`
  - Stage 3c: `cluster_graph`, `get_processes`, `get_impact`
  - Stage 3d: `search_codebase`, `get_context`, `analyze_codebase`,
    `detect_changes`
  - Stage 4: `prepare_prd_input`
  - Stage 6: `validate_prd_against_graph`
  - Stage 8: `check_security_gates`
  - Stage 9: `verify_semantic_diff`
- LadybugDB property graph with 16 node labels, 36+ relationship tables.
- tree-sitter AST extractors for Rust, Python, TypeScript.
- Cross-file resolution (imports, calls, impls) with confidence scoring;
  optional LSP deep resolution (rust-analyzer / pyright /
  typescript-language-server).
- Inline Louvain community detection with C2 repair.
- BFS execution-flow tracing from entry points.
- Hybrid BM25 + sparse TF-IDF + RRF search index (Tantivy-backed).
- Tarjan SCC for cycle detection in semantic-diff.
- 220 tests passing, zero clippy warnings, every numeric constant sourced.

### Architecture

- Hand-rolled stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 (no SDK — owns the wire).
- Clean Architecture with strict module boundaries:
  `transport → server → handlers → core modules → persistence`.
