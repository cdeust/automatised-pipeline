  logical: "Every claim in the paper must have cited evidence"
  critical: "The limitations section lists high-impact potential invalidators, not boilerplate"
  rational: "Structure matches the target venue's expectations"

## Procedure

1. **paper-writer: structure.** Identify the contribution, the claim-evidence chains, and the narrative arc.
2. **paper-writer: draft.** Abstract → intro → related work → method → results → discussion → conclusion. Every claim has a citation or experimental evidence.
3. **difficulty-book: limitations.** darwin: catalog every known weakness, negative result, and open question. The limitations section is not boilerplate; it is the difficulty book.
4. **latex-engineer: format.** Venue-appropriate template, figures, tables, bibliography.
5. **Preview.** Use `tools/live-preview.sh start paper.tex` to launch a live preview of the LaTeX output, auto-recompiling on changes.

## Output Format
